<h2> Hello everybody! &#128075; My name is Nacho, and I have studied a Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp with 4Geeks Academy. </h2>
<p>My goal is to develop my skills as a web developer, and get a job as a FrontEnd developer</p></br>
<p ><strong><i>What am I doing now?</i></strong></p>
<p> Since I've finished my bootcamp, this is what I am investing my time in:
  <ul>
    <li>Reviewing all the contents of the bootcamp ðŸ“š</li>
    <li>Practicing exercises from the academy ðŸ¤“</li>
    <li>Coding some little projects where I can do real web development practice ðŸ’»</li>
   

  </ul>
<p> During my bootcamp, I've learned to use some languages and technologies, as for example:
